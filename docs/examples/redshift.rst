Redshift Estimation
===================

The project described on this page can be found in the `deepforge examples repository <https://github.com/deepforge-dev/examples>`_ on GitHub under the name **redshift-example.webgmex**

This project provides a small collection of generalized pipelines for the training and utilization of redshift estimation models. This branch is designed to allow simple use by only requiring that the configuration parameters of individual nodes be defined where necessary. The most involved alterations that should be necessary for most users is the definition of additional architectures in the **Resources** tab. It should be noted that any newly defined architecture should have an output length and input shape that match the *num_bins* and *input_shape* configuration parameters being used in the various pipelines.

Pipelines
---------

Train Test Single
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Trains and evaluates a single CNN model.  Uses predefined artifacts that contain the training and testing data. For this and all training pipelines, the artifacts should each contain a single numpy array. Input arrays should be a 4D array of shape **(n, y, x, c)** where n=number of images, y=image height,x=image width, and c=number of color channels. Output (label) arrays should be of shape **(n,)** .

.. Visualize Predictions
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Train Test Compare
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Trains and evaluates two CNN models and compares effectiveness of the models.

Download Train Evaluate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Downloads SDSS images, trains a model on the images, and evaluates the model on a separate set of downloaded images.  Care should be taken when defining your own CasJobs query to ensure that all queried galaxies for training have a redshift value below the **Train** node’s *max_val* configuration parameter’s value.

Train Predict
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Trains a single CNN model and uses the newly trained model to predict the redshift value of another set of galaxies.

Predict Pretrained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Predicts the redshift value of a set of galaxies using a pre-existing model that is saved as an artifact.

Test Pretrained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Evaluates the performance of a pre-existing model that is saved as an artifact.

.. Train Visualize
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Download SDSS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download SDSS images and save them as artifacts. Can be used in conjunction with the other pipelines that rely on artifacts rather than images retrieved at execution time.

Download Train Predict
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download SDSS images and use some images to train a model before using the model to predict the redshift value of the remaining galaxies.
